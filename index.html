    <h1> Hiren Madhu</h1>
    <p> I am an incoming PhD student at <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/">Yale CS</a>, where I will be advised by <a href="'https://krishnaswamylab.org/">Professor Smita Krishnaswamy</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/">Professor Rex Ying</a>.</p>
    <p> Earlier, I was an <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~ecepredoc/index.html">ECE pre-doctoral research fellow</a> in <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/">Electrical Communication Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru</a>. I worked with <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/">Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri</a> on unsupervised representation learning for simplicial complexes.
    <p> Before my pre-doc stint, I was a Master of Technology (MTech) student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, advised by <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/">Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri</a>. My master's thesis focused on developing algorithms for simplicial representation learning without labeled data.
    <p> I began my research journey at LDRP Institute of Technology and Research (BE in Computer Engineering) under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J0lkcsQAAAAJ">Sandip Modha</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/fb3/institute/iwist/mitglieder/mandl/">Thomas Mandl</a>, where I focused on the detection of hate speech in public <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417422023600">conversational threads on social media</a>.

    <p> My primary research interest is Machine Learning with Limited Labeled Data (ML3D), especially <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72124">graph representation</a> <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32736"> learning without labels</a>.
